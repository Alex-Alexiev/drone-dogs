# üöÅ Police Chase Drone - ROB498 Capstone Project

![Drone Photo](readme_images/drone_photo.jpg)

## Overview

![Project Banner](readme_images/drone_in_action.gif)

This repository contains the final implementation and documentation for our **ROB498 Capstone Design Project** as part of the **Robotics Engineering** undergraduate program at the **University of Toronto**.

Our project, **Police Chase Drone**, showcases the design and development of an autonomous drone system capable of pursuing a dynamic ground target. Leveraging ROS 2 and onboard computation, the drone tracks and follows a "getaway car" through a series of waypoints and behaviors designed to mimic a pursuit scenario.

## Features

![MobileSSD-Net in Action](readme_images/detectnet.gif)

- üîç **Real-time tracking** of a ground vehicle using onboard sensors and vision using a custom MobileSSD-Net
- üß† **Autonomous navigation** with waypoint following and obstacle avoidance
- üì° **ROS 2-based modular software stack** for sensor integration and control
- üõ∏ **Custom flight behaviors** to simulate realistic police drone pursuits

## System Overview

![Functional Analysis](readme_images/functional_analysis.jpg)

The software system is built in ROS 2 using a set of nodes that handle:

- Perception: Camera input, object detection, and tracking
- Planning: Waypoint generation and trajectory tracking using a state machine
- Control: Velocity and position control for the drone

Here's the state machine diagram that outlines the drone's behavior:

And here is it in action in the simulation:
